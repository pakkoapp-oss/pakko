# DIAGRAMS.md — Required Diagrams for Dead-End & Problem-Area Detection

Diagrams here are a reasoning aid, not an executable test — they don't replace `dotnet test`,
they catch what unit tests structurally can't: illegal/missing state transitions, COM contract
mismatches across process boundaries, and unhandled branches in multi-step validation chains.

## Ground Truth Rule — read before drawing or updating any diagram

**A diagram must reproduce what the code actually does, verified by reading it — never what
seems plausible, symmetric, or "probably how it works."** Specifically:

- Every arrow, branch, and label must trace to a specific file:line you have actually read in
  the current session. If you have not opened the file, you do not know the branch — go read it.
- Do not smooth an asymmetric or ugly code structure into a tidy diagram. If the code has two
  `if`s with an implicit fallthrough (no `else`), draw exactly that — not three clean parallel
  branches. The ugliness is often the point (see the `OnConflict` gate in diagram 3: `Overwrite`
  has no explicit branch and that's a real, load-bearing fact about the code, not an omission
  to tidy up).
- Do not infer execution order from what would be "natural" — verify it. Two operations that
  look independent (e.g. "set `IsBusy=false`" vs. "await a modal dialog") may execute in either
  order depending on where in the method they actually appear; get this from the source, not from
  intuition (see diagram 2, where this was gotten backwards in an earlier draft — the dialog
  await happens *before* `finally`, not after).
- Where the code doesn't name something the diagram needs a label for (e.g. bucketing several
  `catch` blocks into "outcomes"), the label must be immediately followed by the literal
  condition from the code it stands for. Never let an invented label stand alone as if it were
  a real enum or state in the codebase.
- If, while drawing, you find the diagram doesn't match the code you just read, that's a signal
  either the diagram was wrong or the code has a real gap — report both, don't quietly pick
  whichever is more convenient to draw.
- When updating a diagram after a code change, re-derive the affected part from the new source —
  don't edit the old diagram by pattern-matching against its previous shape.

Violating this makes the diagram actively worse than having none: a wrong diagram is trusted
documentation that lies.

## When to update which diagram (Definition of Done)

| Change touches... | Update this diagram | Because |
|---|---|---|
| COM interop, `IExplorerCommand`, process launch (`CreateProcess`, `Process.Start`), `IProgressDialog` | **1. Sequence** | Every real bug so far here (`S_FALSE`, missing `[PreserveSig]`, undeclared `Application`) was a contract mismatch across a process/COM boundary — invisible in unit tests, visible in a sequence diagram. |
| `IsBusy`/cancellation/operation lifecycle in `MainViewModel`, or `NativeProgressDialog` cancel polling | **2. State** | Catches stuck states (a state with no outgoing transition) and commands gated on the wrong `CanExecute`. |
| New branch in `ZipArchiveService` validation/conflict/smart-folder logic | **3. Activity** | Catches silently-dropped entries: a new `continue`/skip path that isn't reflected in `ArchiveResult` (see Finding 2 below for why this matters). |
| MSIX manifest `<Application>` entries, `com:ComServer` registration, packaging of a new satellite EXE | **4. Component** | Catches "works in VS, `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` when packaged" — an EXE that isn't its own declared `Application` entry. |

Update the diagram in the same commit as the code change, alongside `dotnet test` — not as a
follow-up. Re-derive the affected part from the current source per the Ground Truth Rule above;
do not edit by pattern-matching the diagram's previous shape.

            Note over ShellExe: result.SkippedFiles is NEVER inspected here — see Finding 2
        end
    end
```

**What this catches (verified against the two real bugs already fixed here):**
- `EH`/`EF`/`AC` `Invoke()` never awaits the operation — Explorer's HRESULT comes back the instant
  `CreateProcess` returns. Anything that assumes Explorer "waits" for Pakko's result is wrong.
- `HasUserCancelled()` is the one `IProgressDialog` method returning a plain `BOOL`; the
  `[PreserveSig]` boundary is exactly where "Cancel does nothing" lived (`NativeProgressDialog.cs:26`).
- `SubCommandEnum::Next()` returns `S_FALSE` on partial fetch — a *success* code, per
  `(fetched == celt) ? S_OK : S_FALSE` (`ExplorerCommands.cpp:29`). Any new
  `IEnumExplorerCommand`/`IExplorerCommand` method must not conflate `S_FALSE` with failure.
- Visibility filtering happens via `GetState()`, not `EnumSubCommands()` — a future change that
  tries to filter which commands appear by editing `EnumSubCommands` (e.g. "don't enumerate
  Archive for all-ZIP selections") would be editing the wrong method; `ArchiveCommand`'s
  `GetState` condition is the *inverse* of `ExtractHereCommand`/`ExtractFolderCommand`'s, which is
  easy to get backwards when copy-pasting.

## 2. State — Operation lifecycle (`MainViewModel`)

Source read for this diagram: `src/Archiver.App/ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs`
(`ArchiveAsync`/`ExtractAsync`/`Cancel`, lines 228–437). Both methods have the identical
try/catch/finally shape; the diagram applies to either.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Busy: ArchiveCommand/ExtractCommand invoked<br/>(CanExecute: FileItems.Count>0 && !IsBusy)<br/>IsBusy=true
    Busy --> Busy: CancelCommand invoked<br/>(CanExecute: IsOperationRunning == IsBusy)<br/>→ cts.Cancel() only — IsBusy is NOT changed here;<br/>there is no dedicated "Cancelling" state in code
    Busy --> AwaitingSummaryDialog: _archiveService call returns without throwing<br/>StatusMessage set to StatusDone/StatusArchivedIn<br/>(Errors==0 && Skipped==0) or StatusIssues (otherwise)
    AwaitingSummaryDialog --> AwaitingSummaryDialog: await ShowOperationSummaryAsync(...)<br/>IsBusy is STILL TRUE while this modal is open —<br/>finally has not run yet
    AwaitingSummaryDialog --> Idle: finally{IsBusy=false}; then StatusMessage=StatusReady<br/>(unconditional, executes immediately, no delay)
    Busy --> AwaitingErrorDialog: unexpected Exception caught (not OperationCanceledException)<br/>StatusMessage="Error"
    AwaitingErrorDialog --> AwaitingErrorDialog: await ShowErrorAsync(...)<br/>IsBusy is STILL TRUE while this modal is open
    AwaitingErrorDialog --> Idle: finally{IsBusy=false}; then StatusMessage=StatusReady<br/>(unconditional, immediately, no delay)
    Busy --> CancelledNoDialog: OperationCanceledException caught<br/>StatusMessage=StatusCancelled — NO dialog is shown
    CancelledNoDialog --> Idle: finally{IsBusy=false} runs FIRST (immediately);<br/>THEN await Task.Delay(2000) while already back to !IsBusy;<br/>THEN StatusMessage=StatusReady
```

**What this catches:**
- Every exit path sets `IsBusy=false` inside `finally` — no path leaves `Busy` without
  re-enabling controls. A future edit that adds an early `return` before the `finally`, or a new
  `catch` that doesn't fall through to it, would break this.
- **Order matters and was gotten backwards in an earlier draft of this diagram:** for the
  success/issues/error outcomes, the modal dialog (`ShowOperationSummaryAsync` /
  `ShowErrorAsync`) is awaited *before* the `finally` block, so `IsBusy` stays `true` — buttons
  stay disabled — for as long as that dialog is open. For the cancelled outcome there is no
  dialog at all: `IsBusy` flips to `false` immediately, and only *after* that does the fixed
  2-second delay run. So during that 2 seconds the UI is already not-busy (new operations are
  invokable) while the status text still reads "Cancelled" — a real, verified asymmetry, not
  balanced across the two exit families. Worth confirming this is the intended UX; not a
  correctness bug (nothing is stuck), but flagged here since a future diagram-writer must not
  "tidy" this into a symmetric two-branch picture.
- `Cancel`'s `CanExecute` is gated on `IsOperationRunning` (=`IsBusy`) — a future state inserted
  between "user clicked" and `IsBusy=true` would make Cancel uninvokable during it.
- Cancellation itself has no intermediate state: `cts.Cancel()` only sets the token; the running
  `Task.Run` loop notices it at whatever granularity it happens to check
  (`cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested`, or inside `CopyToAsync`, which also observes the
  token). Confirm this still holds for any new async step added inside `ArchiveAsync`/`ExtractAsync`.

## 3. Activity — Extract validation/foldering chain

Source read for this diagram: `ExtractWithSmartFolderingAsync` in
`src/Archiver.Core/Services/ZipArchiveService.cs:463-668`.

    J -- "yes, onConflict==Rename" --> K2[destFilePath renamed via GetUniqueFilePath]
    J -- "yes, onConflict==Overwrite (or any other value)" --> K3["NO explicit branch — falls through<br/>unchanged to K with ORIGINAL destFilePath;<br/>actual overwrite happens later, only if the merge<br/>step's File.Move(overwrite:true) runs"]
    K2 --> K
    K3 --> K
    K[Extract entry to destFilePath in tempDest;<br/>TryPropagateMotw best-effort] --> L[bytesRead += entry.Length]
    S1 & S2 & S3 & S4 & S5 & S6 --> M{More entries?}
    L --> M
    Z --> M
    M -- yes --> A
    M -- no --> N["Commit: Directory.Move(tempDest→actualDest) if actualDest<br/>doesn't exist yet; ELSE merge each tempDest file into<br/>actualDest via File.Move(overwrite:true) — this is where<br/>an Overwrite-conflict entry actually overwrites"]
    N --> O["ArchiveResult.Success = errors.Count == 0<br/>(ZipArchiveService.cs:449) — SkippedFiles is NOT<br/>read anywhere in this computation"]
    O --> P{{"⚠ every branch reachable in normal operation<br/>(D,E,F,H,I,J-Skip) feeds SkippedFiles, never errors.<br/>Only G (path escape) produces an ArchiveError.<br/>So: all-entries-skipped ⇒ Success=true,<br/>an (empty or near-empty) folder is created,<br/>and the shell path never surfaces this (see Finding 2)."}}
```

**What this catches — a live finding, not a hypothetical:**
Every validation gate in this chain (ADS, reserved name, control chars, reparse, ZIP bomb,
`OnConflict=Skip`) routes to `SkippedFiles`, never `ArchiveError`. `ArchiveResult.Success` is
computed as `errors.Count == 0` (`ZipArchiveService.cs:449`) and does not look at `SkippedFiles`
at all. So an archive where *every* entry gets skipped reports `Success=true` with no real content
extracted besides an empty folder.

The GUI path surfaces this correctly — `ShowOperationSummaryAsync` receives the full
`ArchiveResult` including `SkippedFiles`. The **shell path does not**: `Program.cs:235` only calls
`ShowErrorSummary` when `!result.Success || result.Errors.Count > 0` — `SkippedFiles` is never
inspected, so a shell-triggered "Extract here" that skips every entry closes silently with no
dialog at all. Found while drafting this diagram, not fixed — flagging for a `TASKS.md` decision.

**Corrected in this redraw:** the `OnConflict` gate is not three parallel branches for three enum
values. The code is two sequential `if`s with no `else` (`ZipArchiveService.cs:597-609`) — `Skip`
and `Rename` are handled explicitly; `Overwrite` (and any future enum value) has no branch at all
and simply falls through to extraction with the original path, with the actual overwrite deferred
to the final merge step's `File.Move(overwrite: true)`. Drawing this as three clean branches in
the previous version hid that a new `ConflictBehavior` value added later would silently get
"extract unchanged" behavior unless a branch is added for it explicitly.

```

**What this catches:** any satellite EXE added later that is *not* given its own `<Application>`
entry with `EntryPoint="Windows.FullTrustApplication"` will build and run fine from Visual Studio
but fail with `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` the moment it's launched via `CreateProcess` from inside the
installed MSIX package — invisible until on-device testing. This is exactly the bug the
`ShellHelper` entry above was added to fix.

**Finding 1 (doc drift, not fixed here):** `ARCHITECTURE.md:259` currently states *"Registered via
`com:InProcessServer` in `Package.appxmanifest`"*. The actual manifest
(`Package.appxmanifest:70-78`) uses `com:SurrogateServer`, matching `CLAUDE.md`'s own
"Correction — SurrogateServer" note in `DECISIONS.md`. Not fixed here — out of scope for this task.

---

## Findings summary (surfaced while drafting/redrawing, not acted on)

1. **`ARCHITECTURE.md:259` stale** — says `com:InProcessServer`, actual manifest and
   `DECISIONS.md` say `com:SurrogateServer`. Tracked as **T-F69**.
2. **Possible silent-empty-extract bug** — `ArchiveResult.Success` ignores `SkippedFiles`; the
   shell path (`Program.cs:235`) only checks `Errors`, so an all-skipped shell extraction shows
   no dialog at all. Tracked as **T-F68**.
3. **`IsBusy` vs. status-text asymmetry (watch, not confirmed as a bug)** — after a cancelled
   operation, `IsBusy` is already `false` throughout the fixed 2-second `StatusCancelled` display,
   while after a completed/errored operation `IsBusy` stays `true` for as long as the summary/error
   dialog is open. Different exit families leave the UI in observably different "is this really
   done" states. Tracked as **T-F70**.
